About this dataset:

This biomedical dataset was built by Dr. Henrique da Mota during a medical residence period in the Group of Applied Research in Orthopaedics (GARO) of the Centre Médico-Chirurgical de Réadaptation des Massues, Lyon, France. The data has been organized in two different, but related, classification tasks.

The first task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one of three categories:

Normal (100 patients)
Disk Hernia (60 patients)
Spondylolisthesis (150 patients)
For the second task, the categories Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis were merged into a single category that is labeled as abnormal. Thus, the second task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one of two categories: Normal (100 patients) or Abnormal (210 patients).

Attribute information:

Each patient is represented in the dataset by six biomechanical attributes that are derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine (in this order):

Pelvic incidence
Pelvic tilt
Lumbar lordosis angle
Sacral slope
Pelvic radius
Grade of spondylolisthesis
The following convention is used for the class labels:

DH (Disk Hernia)
Spondylolisthesis (SL)
Normal (NO)
Abnormal (AB)
